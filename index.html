            <p>
              Spirit files for Chapter 11 and begins its first balance-sheet restructuring,
              targeting deleveraging and new capital after the failed JetBlue transaction.

            <p>
              Spirit conducts an equity rights offering, restructures funded debt, and

              with a revised capital structure.

              Despite the first restructuring, macro and operational headwinds continue.

            <p>
              A second filing follows. The new case focuses on a deeper reset:
              a creditor-led DIP facility, roll-up of prepetition notes,
              and a more significant fleet and cost transformation.

            <p>
              The court approves the DIP credit agreement. Existing secured noteholders
              are invited to participate, providing new money and rolling part of
              their prepetition exposure into superpriority DIP claims.

              Spirit cuts capacity, negotiates with lessors, exits weaker routes,
              and adjusts staffing as it reshapes the airline around a smaller,
              more focused network and multi-year recovery plan.

          <h3>Key elements</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
              A multi-tranche <strong>DIP term loan</strong> provides liquidity during the case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Existing <strong>secured noteholders</strong> supply the DIP and
              receive the ability to <strong>roll up</strong> part of their
              prepetition exposure into DIP claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              The capital structure shifts from emergent, equity-supported funding
              to a more classic <strong>creditor-owned turnaround</strong> model.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legacy equity sits at the bottom of the waterfall and is likely
              wiped or heavily diluted in any confirmed plan.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="note">
            For corporate actions teams, the most visible mechanics are the
            DIP participation and roll-up elections that appear as
            complex voluntary events with strict eligibility criteria,
            deadlines, and allocation logic.
