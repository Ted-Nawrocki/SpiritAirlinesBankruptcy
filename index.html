            <p>
              Spirit files for Chapter 11 and begins its first balance-sheet restructuring,
              targeting deleveraging and new capital after the failed JetBlue transaction.

              A second filing follows. The new case focuses on a deeper reset:
              a creditor-led DIP facility, roll-up of prepetition notes,
              and a more significant fleet and cost transformation.

              The court approves the DIP credit agreement. Existing secured noteholders

        <h2>Capital Structure & DIP Overview</h2>

          How existing bondholders moved from traditional secured creditors to DIP lenders

          <h3>Key elements</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
              A multi-tranche <strong>DIP term loan</strong> provides liquidity during the case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Existing <strong>secured noteholders</strong> supply the DIP and
              receive the ability to <strong>roll up</strong> part of their
              prepetition exposure into DIP claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              The capital structure shifts from emergent, equity-supported funding
              to a more classic <strong>creditor-owned turnaround</strong> model.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legacy equity sits at the bottom of the waterfall and is likely
              wiped or heavily diluted in any confirmed plan.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="note">
            For corporate actions teams, the most visible mechanics are the
            DIP participation and roll-up elections that appear as
            complex voluntary events with strict eligibility criteria,
            deadlines, and allocation logic.

              Capacity is cut as unprofitable routes are exited and the focus shifts toward stronger markets.

            <li>
              Labor and staffing levels are adjusted to align with a smaller fleet and network footprint.

              Management’s projections rely on a smaller, leaner airline generating improved margins
